# Car-price-prediction
Car Price Prediction This project utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the prices of used cars based on various features such as brand, model, mileage, year of manufacture, fuel type,  and more. The goal is to provide an accurate estimation of a car's value using historical data and advanced algorithms.
# Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming raw car data for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identifying patterns and insights in car prices.
Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features to improve prediction accuracy.
Model Training: Using regression models such as Linear Regression.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like RÂ².
# Tools & Libraries:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
